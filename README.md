# Valorant Stat Tracker

Not currently usable; project was deployed to and paid for by the professor so plans to redeploy are unknown.

## **Summary**

Current popular stat trackers such as [tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg/) sometimes cannot accurately pull match data and make it hard to visualize game performance over time with all their screen clutter. The purpose of this program is to improve visual clarity of overall match performances and to keep track of only specific statistics.   
## **How To Use**

Go to website here: http://3.238.242.230/~saehaana/ 
Login or signup if you haven't made an account

Users will be able to track their matches played by entering them into the system using a fillable form.
